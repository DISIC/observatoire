    <note>
     Ensure that URLs ending with .gwtrpc are not modified.
     Note: Not needed with XWiki 9.7+ since the GWT editor has been removed.

      Ensure that URLs that must not be served by the Struts Servlet are not modified.

    <note>
      For all other URLs we prepend the "/bin/" prefix so that they get routed to the XWiki Action Servlet.

    <note>
      Rewrite outbound URLs to remove the "/wiki/demarches" part when there are two paths after it.
