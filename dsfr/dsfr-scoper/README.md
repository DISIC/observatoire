# DSFR prefixer

##Â Disclaimer

This script is meant to be a TEMPORARY SOLUTION in order to load dsfr component alongside bootstrap ones.
It is not guaranteed to be 100% effective, but has been tested in the scope of the mission, and it is fulfilling our needs in the meantime of a better solution.

## Presentation

This script is used to prefix every dsfr rules with a specific selector string.
This has two advantages:
- scoping: no dsfr styles are going to mess with existing styles outside of the form element
- higher rule precedence: the dsfr rule gain more precedence, allowing to take over existing bootstrap rules

The prefixer will also take care of `:root`, `html` and `body` rules, to some extent:
```css
:root[data-theme="dark"] .my-class{
  /* ... */
}

/* will be transformed into: */

:root[data-theme="dark"] #specific-prefix .my-class {
  /* ... */
}
```

However, for more complex rules, it might not work as intended:

```css
body > .direct-child {
  /* ... */
}

/* will be transformed into: */

body #specific-prefix > .direct-child {
  /* ... */
}

/* instead of: */

body > .direct-child #specific-prefix {
  /* ... */
}
```

However there are no such rules in the dsfr css files, so for the scope of this project this should not be a problem.

## Installation & execution

The prefixing of dsfr styles is a manual step in the deployment of the project, as it is not meant to be a final solution.

For this, first download this directory onto your machine.
You need to have node.js installed, the latest LTS version should work.

Inside the folder, fetch npm dependencies using:
```sh
$ npm install
```

Then simply execute `index.js` to generate the `dist/` folder of the dsfr, but with scoped styles:
```sh
$ node index.js
```

The generated folder should be named `dsfr-scoped/`, and you can now copy it (without modification) inside the `web/src/main/webapp/uicomponents/` folder of the project.

Note:
The dsfr version currently used is 1.3.1. The version has been pinned inside `package.json`, to prevent unwanted breakage. You can change the version there if you want, at your own risk.
